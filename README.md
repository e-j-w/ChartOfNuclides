An offline viewer of isotope and nuclear structure data in the [Chart of Nuclides / Segr√® chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_nuclides) format. Uses nuclear structure data from [ENSDF](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ensdf/about.jsp), masses from [AME2020](https://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/web/masseval.html), and isotopic abundance data from [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-relative-atomic-masses). A full list of features is [here](doc/FEATURES.md).

## Quick installation (Linux)

Get the latest [release](https://github.com/e-j-w/ChartOfNuclides/releases) and follow the installation instructions there. Support for other platforms is planned for the future.
