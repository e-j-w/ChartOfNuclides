<b>Chart of Nuclides GUI</b>

</div>

## Description

**NOTE: This is early in development and has limited functionality right now.**

An offline viewer of isotope and nuclear structure data, presented in the familiar [Chart of Nuclides / Segr√® chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_nuclides) format.  The UI is implemented in [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (so you can browse nuclear half-lives using some of the same code that powers [Half-Life](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Half-Life#Middleware)).  The program parses various plaintext nuclear structure data (listed [here](#collect-data)) into a binary database, eventually one will be able to query this for information on various nuclei (levels, cascades, gamma-rays).

The goal is to develop a performant and multiplatform tool that will be useful in both professional (nuclear structure research) and educational contexts.

## Features

- Runs locally, with no network connection needed.
- Select individual nuclides to browse ground and isomeric state data.
- More to come...

## Building and installing from source

### Collect data

If you're building the database from scratch, you'll need various isotope and nuclear structure data, from the sources below:

| Data       | Source location | Instructions |
| :--------- | :---------------| :----------- |
| Nuclear structure data    |  [ENSDF](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ensarchivals/) | Download the zip archive from the link in the 'Latest Dataset' section. Unzip it in the source tree into the directory `data/ensdf/` (such that the `ensdf` subdirectory contains the files `ensdf.001`, `ensdf.002`, etc.). |
| Isotope abundance data    | [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-relative-atomic-masses) | Under 'Search the Database', select 'All Elements', output type 'Linearized ASCII Output', with the option 'Most common isotopes'.  Select 'Get Data'.  Copy the resulting plaintext data into a text file, save the text file in the source tree under `data/abundances.txt`. |

### Build dependencies

* C compiler: gcc (or clang)
* GNU make
* SDL3, SDL_image, SDL_ttf

The current version has been tested under Arch Linux as of June 2024.  For now SDL3 and its libraries probably have to be compiled manually, as they aren't (yet) packaged for major Linux distros.

### Build the database and program

Install all build dependencies listed above, then build the application binaries using `make` (from the source tree root directory):

```
# using gcc:
make all -j
# alternatively, using clang:
make all -j CC=clang
```

Two executables will be built: `proc_data` (which generates the data package `con.dat` containing the nuclear structure database used by the main application), and `con` (the main application). Obtain the [required data files](#collect-data), then build the nuclear structure database and generate the packaged data file (`con.dat`) by running: 

```
./proc_data
```

This will build the data package file `con.dat`. Then, the main application can be run:

```
./con
```

Have fun!

## Using the program

Zoom and pan with the mouse, the controls are basically identical to something like Google Maps.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key                | Action |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Arrow keys / WASD  | Pan chart view |
| +/-                | Zoom in/out on chart |
| Escape / backspace | Exit out of open menus, cancel selection, etc. |
| F11                | Toggle fullscreen mode |
| P                  | Toggle performance stats debug overlay |
