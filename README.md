<b>Chart of Nuclides GUI</b>

</div>

## Description

**NOTE: This is extremely early in development and has very limited functionality right now.**

An offline viewer of isotope and nuclear structure data, presented in the familiar [Chart of Nuclides / Segr√® chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_nuclides) format.  The UI is implemented in [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (so you can browse nuclear half-lives using some of the same code that powers [Half-Life](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Half-Life#Middleware)).  The program parses various plaintext nuclear structure data (listed [here](#collect-data)) into a binary database, eventually one will be able to query this for information on various nuclei (levels, cascades, gamma-rays).

The goal is to develop a performant and multiplatform tool that will be useful in both professional (nuclear structure research) and educational contexts.

## Features

TBD

## Installing from source

**NOTE: Instructions are still incomplete and are missing critical steps.  Don't try this at home (yet)!**

### Collect data

If building the database from scratch, you will need various isotope and nuclear structure data, from the sources below:

| Data       | Source location | Instructions |
| :--------- | :---------------| :----------- |
| Nuclear structure data    |  [ENSDF](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ensarchivals/) | Download the zip archive from the link in the 'Latest Dataset' section. Unzip it in the source tree into the directory `data/ensdf/` (such that the `ensdf` subdirectory contains the files `ensdf.001`, `ensdf.002`, etc.). |
| Isotope abundance data    | [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-relative-atomic-masses) | Under 'Search the Database', select 'All Elements', output type 'Linearized ASCII Output', with the option 'Most common isotopes'.  Select 'Get Data'.  Copy the resulting plaintext data into a text file, save the text file in the source tree under `data/abundances.txt`. |

### Install build dependencies

* gcc (or clang if the Makefile is edited)
* make
* SDL3
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf

The current version has been tested under Arch Linux as of June 2024.

### Build the database and program

The program relies on additional data files, which can be obtained from **TBD**.  The embedded font used needs to support special UTF-8 characters in order to display info such as decay modes correctly.

Install all build dependencies listed above.  For now SDL3 and its libraries probably have to be compiled manually, as they aren't (yet) packaged for major Linux distros.

First, run `make` in the source root directory. Two executables will be built: `proc_data` (which generates the data package `con.dat` containing the nuclear structure database used by the main application), and `con` (the main application). Build the database and generate the packaged data file (`con.dat`) by running: 

```
./proc_data
```

This will build the data package file `con.dat`. Then, the main application can be run:

```
./con
```

## Using the program

Zoom and pan with the mouse, the controls are basically identical to something like Google Maps.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key               | Action |
| :---------------- | :----- |
| Arrow keys / WASD | Pan chart view |
| +/-               | Zoom in/out on chart |
| F11               | Toggle fullscreen mode |
| P                 | Toggle performance stats debug overlay |
